                <h5>AUNT CANDACE.</h5> <p>Honey, I's been a-waitin' foh you de las' two hours. My

                    <h5>MARY</h5> <p>opens her hand and shows her a five-dollar bill_.

                <h5>AUNT CANDACE.</h5><p> De Lawd help my life, chile!
            </p>
            
                <h5>MARY.</h5><p>An' look here what Mr. Henry sent you, too.</p><p>[_She undoes the
                bundle, revealing several cooked sweet potatoes, sausages, spareribs,
                and some boiled ham._]
            </p>  
                <p>
                    He said as 'twas Christmas time he sent you this with the collards there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    _She points toward the collards at the window._ AUNT ACE _pays
                    little attention to the food as_ MARY _placit in her lap, but
                    continues to look straight into_ MARY'S _face. The girl starts to
                    give her the money, but she pushes her away._
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whah'd you git dat, honey? Whah'd you git it? Mr. Henry ain't never been dat kind befo'. Dey ain't no past
                Christmas times he was so free wid 'is money. He ain't de kind o' man

                <p>
                    Chile, Mr. Hugh didn't give you dat money, didhe?
                </p>
            <p>
                <h5>MARY.</h5><p> [_Still looking in the fire._]

            </p> 
                <p>
                    Aunty, I ain't said Mr. Henry sent you this money. Yes'm, Mr. Hugh sent it to you. I done some washin' for
                him. I washed his socks and some shirts--pure silk they was.
            </p> 
                <p>
                    [_She smiles at the remembrance._]

                 An' he give me the money an' tole me to give it to you--said he wished he could give you somethin' more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [_She hands the money to_ AUNT CANDACE, _who takes it quickly_.

                <h5>AUNT CANDACE.</h5> <p>Help my soul an' body! De boy said dat! Bless 'is soul! He
                ain't fo'got 'is ol' aunty, even if he ain't been to see 'er since he

                    <h5>MARY</h5> <p>goes to the bureau and gets a tin box. She puts the money
                    in it, returns it, and lights the lamp._ AUNT CANDACE _takes off
                    her bonnet and hangs it behind her on the rocking-chair. Then she
                    begins to eat greedily, now and then licking the grease off her
                    fingers. Suddenly she utters a low scream, putting her hands to her
                    head and rocking to and fro. She grasps her stick and begins
                    beating about her as if striking at something, crying out in a loud
                    voice._
                </p>
            
                <h5>AUNT CANDACE.</h5><p> Ah-hah, I'll git you! I'll git you!
            </p> 

                
                    <h5>MARY</h5> <p>goes to her and pats her on the cheek_.
